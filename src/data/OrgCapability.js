    info: 'We have in-house translation capacity for a range of different languages, including Dari, English and Pashto. When local dialects come into the picture, our producer Sultan himself assists the process due to this extensive knowledge of various Afghan dialects. When translation capabilities become stretched, translation companies may be made use of; however, a final check is always conducted in house.'

    info: 'We operate on a country-wide scale as we have access to a vast network of actors across the country. Prior to any production, we make use of this network to identify all relevant stakeholders to inform them about the project and obtain permission to work in a specific province, city, village, or community. Once the work is underway, Kuchi Films ensures that the respective community is involved in the process by placing great emphasis on getting to know and maintaining contact with the community.'
